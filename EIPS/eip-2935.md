## Abstract

Store last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` historical block hashes in the storage of a system contract as part of the block processing logic.

## Motivation

EVM implicitly assumes the client has the recent block (hashes) at hand. This assumption is not future-proof given the prospect of stateless clients. Including the block hashes in the state will allow bundling these hashes in the witness provided to a stateless client. This is already possible in the MPT and will become more efficient post-Verkle.

Extending the range of blocks BLOCKHASH can serve is a semantics change. Using the contract storage would allow extending that range in a soft-transition. Rollups can benefit from the longer history window through directly querying this contract.

A side benefit of this approach could be that it allows building/validating proofs related to last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` ancestors directly against the current state.

## Specification

| Parameter | Value |
| - | - |
| `FORK_TIMESTAMP` | TBD |
| `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` | `0x25a219378dad9b3503c8268c9ca836a52427a4fb`|
| `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` | `8192` |
| `BLOCKHASH_OLD_WINDOW` | `256` |

This EIP specifies for storing last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` block hashes in a ring buffer storage of `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` length.

At the start of processing any block where `block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP` (ie. before processing any transactions), update the history in the following way:

```python
def process_block_hash_history(block: Block, state: State):
    if block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP:
        state.insert_slot(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, (block.number-1) % HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW , block.parent.hash)
```

Note that, it will take `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` blocks after `FORK_TIMESTAMP` to completely fill up the ring buffer. The contract will only contain the parent hash of the fork block and no hashes prior to that.

The `BLOCKHASH` opcode semantics remains the same as before.

### Contract Implementation

Exact evm assembly that can be used for the contract to resolve `BLOCKHASH`

```
// check if input > 8 byte value and revert if this isn't the case
// the check is performed by comparing the biggest 8 byte number with
// the call data, which is a right-padded 32 byte number.
push8 0xffffffffffffffff
push0
calldataload
gt
push1 0x39
jumpi

// check if input > blocknumber-1 then return 0
push1 0x1
number
sub
push0
calldataload
gt
push1 0x31
jumpi

// check if blocknumber > input + 8192 then return 0, no overflow expected for input of 8 bytes
push0
calldataload
push2 0x2000
add
number
gt
push1 0x31
jumpi

// mod 8192 and sload
push2 0x1FFF
push0
calldataload
and
sload

// load into mem and return 32 bytes
push0
mstore
push1 0x20
push0
return

// return 0
jumpdest
push0
push0
mstore
push1 0x20
push0
return

// revert
jumpdest
push0
push0
revert

stop
```

Note that the input contract read `32` bytes input as `calldataload`. Users and clients doing EVM call to this contract should left pad the `arg` correctly.

<!-- TODO: bytecode is based off on first version and will be updated once assembley is locked down as it changes contract sender and address -->

Corresponding bytecode:
`60203611603157600143035f35116029575f356120000143116029576120005f3506545f5260205ff35b5f5f5260205ff35b5f5ffd00`

#### Deployment

A special synthetic address is generated by working backwards from the desired deployment transaction:

```json
{
  "type": "0x0",
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "to": null,
  "gas": "0x3d090",
  "gasPrice": "0xe8d4a51000",
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": null,
  "maxFeePerGas": null,
  "value": "0x0",
  "input": "0x60368060095f395ff360203611603157600143035f35116029575f356120000143116029576120005f3506545f5260205ff35b5f5f5260205ff35b5f5ffd00",
  "v": "0x1b",
  "r": "0x539",
  "s": "0x1b9b6eb1f0",
  "hash": "7ba81426bfa88a2cf4ea5c9abbbe83619505acd1173bc8450f93cf17cde3784b",
}
```

Note, the input in the transaction has a simple constructor prefixing the desired runtime code.

The sender of the transaction can be calculated as `0xa4690f0ed0d089faa1e0ad94c8f1b4a2fd4b0734`. The address of the first contract deployed from the account is `rlp([sender, 0])` which equals `0x25a219378dad9b3503c8268c9ca836a52427a4fb`. This is how `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` is determined. Although this style of contract creation is not tied to any specific initcode like create2 is, the synthetic address is cryptographically bound to the input data of the transaction (e.g. the initcode).


Some activation scenarios:

 * For the fork to be activated at genesis, no history is written to the genesis state, and at the start of block `1`, genesis hash will be written as a normal operation to slot `0`.
 * for activation at block `1`, only genesis hash will be written at slot `0`.
 * for activation at block `32`, block `31`'s hash will be written to slot `31`. Every other slot will be `0`.

### [EIP-158](./eip-158.md) handling

The bytecode above will be deployed Ã  la [EIP-4788](./eip-4788.md). It just supports a `get` method to resolve block hashes. As such the account at `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` will have code and a nonce of 1, and will be exempt from EIP-158 cleanup.

### Gas costs

The gas cost of the `BLOCKHASH` opcode is unchanged. Importantly the processing at the beginning of the block, i.e. `process_block_hash_history`, will not warm the `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` account or its storage slots as per [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) rules. As such the first call to the contract will pay for warming up the account and storage slots it accesses.

## Rationale

Very similar ideas were proposed before in [EIP-210](./eip-210.md) et al. This EIP is a simplification, removing two sources of needless complexity:

1. Having a tree-like structure with multiple layers as opposed to a single list
2. Writing the EIP in EVM code
3. Serial unbounded storage of hashes for a deep access to the history

However after weighing pros and cons, we decided to go with just a limited ring buffer to only serve the requisite `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` as [EIP-4788](./eip-4788.md) and beacon state accumulators allow (albeit a bit more complex) proof against any ancestor since merge.

Second concern was how to best transition the BLOCKHASH resolution logic post fork by:

1. Either waiting for  `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` blocks for the entire relevant history to persist
2. Storing of all last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` block hashes on the fork block.

We choose to go with the former. It simplifies the logic greatly. It will take roughly a day to bootstrap the contract. Given that this is a new way of accessing history and no contract depends on it, it is deemed a favorable tradeoff.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces backwards incompatible changes to the block validation rule set. But neither of these changes break anything related to current user activity and experience.

## Test Cases

TBD

## Security Considerations

Having contracts (system or otherwise) with hot update paths (branches) poses a risk of "branch" poisioning attacks where attacker could sprinkle trivial amounts of eth around these hot paths (branches). But it has been deemed that cost of attack would escalate significantly to cause any meaningful slow down of state root updates.
