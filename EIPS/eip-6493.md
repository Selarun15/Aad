## Abstract

This EIP defines a signature scheme for [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/ssz/simple-serialize.md) encoded transactions.

## Motivation

Existing [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction types first encoded in the RLP format, and then hashed using keccak256 for signing and finally (post signing) to generate a unique transaction identifier as well.

However for new transaction types that are encoded in the SSZ format (for e.g. [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) blob transactions), it is idiomatic to base their signature hash and their unique identifier on `hash_tree_root` instead.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### SSZ transaction schema

For each SSZ transaction type, its specification defines an SSZ type that contains all transaction data to be signed.

```python
class XyzTransaction(View):
    ...
```

The specification also defines an SSZ type that represents the transaction's signature.

```python
class XyzSignature(View):
    ...
```

The signed transaction combines the unsigned transaction data with its signature.

```python
class XyzSignedTransaction(Container):
    message: XyzTransaction
    signature: XyzSignature
```

The unique transaction identifier is defined as this signed container's SSZ `hash_tree_root`.

When representing such a transaction as part of the [execution block header's `txs-root`](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/bd17dac4228c69b6379644355f373669f74952cd/caps/eth.md#block-encoding-and-validity) Merkle-Patricia Trie, this unique transaction identifier is embedded instead of the transaction's raw network representation.

### Network configuration

Each SSZ transaction type is introduced to a network during a fork transition. As part of this transition, an [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction type is assigned.

### Signature scheme

When an SSZ transaction is signed, additional information is mixed into the signed hash to uniquely identify the underlying SSZ scheme as well as the operating network.

| Name | SSZ equivalent | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `chain_id` | `uint256` | [EIP-155](./eip-155.md) chain ID at time of signature |
| `tx_type` | `TransactionType` | Assigned [EIP-2718](./eip-2718) transaction type |

The following helper functions compute the [`Domain`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types) for signing an SSZ transaction.

```python
class TransactionDomainData(Container):
    tx_type: TransactionType
    chain_id: uint256

def compute_transaction_domain(
    tx_type: TransactionType,
    chain_id: uint256,
) -> Domain:
    return Domain(TransactionDomainData(
        tx_type=tx_type,
        chain_id=chain_id,
    ).hash_tree_root())
```

The [`Root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types) to sign is computed using [`compute_signing_root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#compute_signing_root) based on the unsigned transaction's `hash_tree_root` and the additional information about the transaction type.

```python
class SigningData(Container):
    object_root: Root
    domain: Domain

def compute_signing_root(ssz_object: SSZObject, domain: Domain) -> Root:
    return hash_tree_root(SigningData(
        object_root=hash_tree_root(ssz_object),
        domain=domain,
    ))
```

## Rationale

### Why mix in additional data?

Simply using `hash_tree_root` of the unsigned transaction may lead to conflicting signatures, because objects from different SSZ types may result in the same root hash. Therefore, the transaction type must be mixed into the signed hash.

Mixing in the chain ID allows SSZ transaction types to drop the chain ID in their payload. A transaction with incorrect chain ID still decodes correctly, but `ecrecover` computes a different signer (with no balance to pay for gas).

### Why not keccak256?

SSZ and RLP objects encode differently. Namely, in an encoded signed SSZ transaction, it is not guaranteed that the `chain_id` and the signature are at the same location as in the RLP transaction. This could be problematic if two different networks accidentally use the same [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction type number to define an RLP encoded transaction type on one network, but an SSZ encoded transaction type on the other. A signed transaction on one network could become a valid transaction on the other network.

## Backwards Compatibility

The new signature scheme is solely used for new transaction types.

Existing software that incorrectly assumes that all transaction identifiers are based on `keccak256` may have to be updated.

## Test Cases

```python
# Network configuration
CHAIN_ID = uint256(424242)

# Example SSZ transaction
EXAMPLE_TX_TYPE = TransactionType(0xab)

class ExampleTransaction(Container):
    nonce: uint64
    max_fee_per_gas: uint256
    gas: uint64
    tx_to: ExecutionAddress
    tx_value: uint256

class ExampleSignature(ByteVector[65]):
    pass

class ExampleSignedTransaction(Container):
    message: ExampleTransaction
    signature: ExampleSignature

def compute_example_sig_hash(message: ExampleTransaction) -> Hash32:
    domain = compute_transaction_domain(
        EXAMPLE_TX_TYPE,
        CHAIN_ID,
    )
    return compute_signing_root(message, domain)

def compute_example_tx_hash(signed_tx: ExampleSignedTransaction) -> Hash32:
    return signed_tx.hash_tree_root()

# Example transaction
message = ExampleTransaction(
    nonce=42,
    max_fee_per_gas=69123456789,
    gas=21000,
    tx_to=ExecutionAddress(bytes.fromhex('d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045')),
    tx_value=3_141_592_653,
)
sig_hash = compute_example_sig_hash(message)

privkey = PrivateKey()
raw_sig = privkey.ecdsa_sign_recoverable(sig_hash, raw=True)
sig, y_parity = privkey.ecdsa_recoverable_serialize(raw_sig)
assert y_parity in (0, 1)

signed_tx = ExampleSignedTransaction(
    message=message,
    signature=ExampleSignature(sig + bytes([y_parity])),
)
tx_hash = compute_example_tx_hash(signed_tx)
```

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Security Considerations

SSZ does not guarantee that the `signature` field always ends up in the same location. If the signature is variable-length, or if the unsigned transaction data is constant-length, the signature will be located at the end. Otherwise, it will be located at offset 4. This means that SSZ transactions of different types may share the same representation, but are interpreted differently. See [example](../assets/eip-6493/security/collision.py).

Even though the leading [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction type byte is not directly incorporated into `message.hash_tree_root()`, it _is_ hashed into `sig_hash`, together with enough additional information to ensure that the signature really pertains to a specific transaction scheme from a specific specification on a specific chain. Therefore, even if an attacker modifies the leading byte to trigger a different interpretation, the public key recovered from that different interpretation will not refer to a used `ExecutionAddress`. This assumption holds as long as there is only a single signer.
