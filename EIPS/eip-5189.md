## Abstract
This EIP proposes a form of account abstraction that ensures compatibility with existing smart contract wallets and provides flexibility for alternative designs while avoiding introducing changes to the consensus layer. Instead of defining a strict structure for meta-transactions, this proposal introduces the figure of `endorser` contracts. These smart contract instances are tasked with determining the quality of the submitted meta-transactions, thus safely helping bundlers determine if a meta-transaction should be kept in the mempool or not. Developers that intend to make their smart contract wallet compatible with this EIP must create and deploy an instance of an `endorser`; this instance must be seeded with a small amount of ETH to be burnt that incentivizes its good behavior.

## Motivation
This account abstraction proposal aims to implement a generalized system for executing meta-transactions while maintaining the following goals:

* **Achieve the primary goal of account abstraction:** allow users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification and execution logic instead of EOAs as their primary account.
* **Decentralization:**
* * Allow any bundler to participate in the process of including meta-transactions.
* * Work with all activity happening over a public mempool without having to concentrate transactions on centralized relayers.
* * Define structures that help maintain a healthy mempool without risking its participants from getting flooded with invalid or malicious payloads.
* * Avoid trust assumptions between bundlers, developers, and wallets.
* **Support existing smart contract wallet implementations:** Work with all the smart contract wallets already deployed and active while avoiding forcing each wallet instance to be manually upgraded.
* **Provide an unrestrictive framework:** Smart contract wallets are very different in design, limitations, and capabilities from one another; the proposal is designed to accommodate almost all possible variations.
* **No overhead:** Smart contract wallets already have a cost overhead compared to EOA alternatives, the proposal does not worsen the current situation.
* **Support other use cases:**
* * Privacy-preserving applications.
* * Atomic multi-operations (similar to EIP-3074).
* * Payment of transaction fees using ERC-20 tokens.
* * Scheduled execution of smart contracts without any user input.
* * Applications that require a generalistic relayer.

## Specification
To avoid Ethereum consensus changes, we do not attempt to create new transaction types for account-abstracted transactions. Instead, meta-transactions are packed up in a struct called `Operation`, operations are structs composed by the following fields:

| Field             | Type    | Description                                                                                            |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| entrypoint        | address | contract address that must be called with `callData` to execute the `operation`.                   |
| callData          | bytes   | data that must be passed to the `entrypoint` call to execute the `operation`.                    |
| gasLimit          | uint64  | minimum gasLimit that must be passed when executing the `operation`.                             |
| endorser          | address | address of the endorser contract that should be used to validate the `operation`.                      |
| endorserGasLimit  | uint64  | amount of gas that should be passed to the endorser when validating the `operation`.                   |
| maxFeePerGas      | uint256 | max amount of basefee that the `operation` execution is expected to pay, (similar to EIP-1559 `max_fee_per_gas`) |
| priorityFeePerGas | uint256 | fixed amount of fees that the `operation` execution is expected to pay to the bundler (similar to EIP-1559 `max_priority_fee_per_gas`).                 |

These `Operation` objects can be sent to a dedicated operations mempool. A specialized class of actors called bundlers (either miners running special-purpose code, or just users that can relay transactions to miners) listen for operations on the mempool and execute these transactions.

Transactions are executed by calling the `entrypoint` with the provided `callData`. The `entrypoint` can be any contract, but most commonly it will be the wallet contract itself, alternatively it can be an intermediary utility that deploys the wallet and then performs the transaction.

#### Endorser functionality
Mempool participants need to be able to able to filter "good operations" (operations that pay the bundler the defined fee) from "bad operations" (operations that either miss payment or revert altogether).

This categorization is facilitated by the `endorser`; the endorser must be a deployed smart contract that implements the following interface:

```solidity
interface Endorser {
  struct Dependency {
    address addr;
    bool balance;
    bool code;
    bool nonce;
    bytes32[] slots;
  }

  function isOperationReady(
    address _entrypoint,
    bytes calldata _data,
    uint256 _gasLimit,
    uint256 _maxFeePerGas,
    uint256 _maxPriorityFeePerGas
  ) external view returns (
    bool readiness,
    Dependency[] memory dependencies
  );
}
```

It should also be registered in the `EndorserRegistry` with a minimum amount of burned ETH (Mempool operators are free to accept operations from endorsers without any burn, but they would increase their risk exposing themselves to denial of service attacks).

When the `isOperationReady` method is called, the endorser must return this information:

* **readiness:** when returning`true`, it means the transaction WILL be executed correctly and the bundler WILL be paid the offered gas fees (even if the underlying intent of the operation fails).
* **dependencies:** a comprehensive list of addresses and storage slots that must be monitored; any state change in these dependencies MUST trigger a re-evaluation of the operation's readiness.

The information provided by the endorser helps the mempool operator maintain a pool of "good" meta-transactions that behave correctly; it DOES NOT guarantee that such transactions will be able to be executed correctly. Bundlers must always simulate the result of the execution before including a transaction in a block.

#### Dependencies
| Field | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| addr     | address     | Contract address of the dependencies entry *(only one entry per address should be allowed)*.      |
| balance     | bool     | `true` if the balance of `addr` should be considered a dependency of the `operation`.      |
| code     | bool     | `true` if the code of `addr` should be considered a dependency of the `operation`.      |
| nonce     | bool     | `true` if the nonce of `addr` should be considered a dependency of the `operation`.      |
| slots | bytes32[] | List of all storage slots of `addr` that should be considered dependencies of `operation`. |

The `endorser` does not need to include all accessed storage slots on the dependencies list, it only needs to include storage slots that after a change may also result in a change of readiness.

> E.g. A wallet may pay fees using funds stored as WETH. During `isValidOperation()`, the endorser contract may call the `balanceOf` method of the `WETH` contract to determine if the wallet has enough `WETH` balance. Even though the ETH balance of the WETH contract and the code of the WETH contract are being accessed, the endorser only cares about the user's WETH balance for this operation and hence does not include these as dependencies.

### Misbehavior detection
The `endorser` contracts may behave maliciously or erratically in the following ways:

* (1) It may consider an operation `ready`, but when the operation is executed it transfers less than the agreed-upon fees to the bundler.
* (2) It may consider an operation `ready`, but when the operation is executed the top-level call fails.
* (3) It may change the status from `ready` to `not-ready` while none of the dependencies register any change.

The bundler must always discard and re-evaluate the readiness status after a change on any of the dependencies of the `operation`, meaning that only operations considered `ready` are candidates for constructing the next block.

If, when simulating the final inclusion of the operation, the bundler discovers that it does not result in correct payment (either because the transaction fails, or transferred amount is below the defined fee), then it should proceed to ban the `endorser` for one of the following reasons:

1) The `endorser` returns `isOperationReady == true` even though the `operation` is not healthy to be included in a block.
2) The `operation` changed readiness status from `true` to `false` while all dependencies remained unchanged.

After an `endorser` is banned, the mempool operator should drop all `operations` related to such endorser.

> Notice: The mempool operator could call one last time `isOperationReady` to determine if the `endorser` should be banned because `(1)` or `(2)`, but this step is not strictly necessary since both scenarios lead to the `endoser` being banned.

### Client behavior upon receiving an operation
When a client receives an `operation`, it must first run some basic sanity checks, namely that:

* The `endorserGasLimit` is sufficiently low (<= `MAX_ENDORSER_GAS`).
* The endorser (i) is registered and has enough burn (>= `MIN_ENDORSER_BURN`), and (ii) it has not been internally flagged as banned.
* The `gasLimit` is at least the cost of a `CALL` with a non-zero value.
* The `maxFeePerGas` and `priorityPerGas` are above a configurable minimum value the client is willing to accept.
* If another operation exists in the mempool with the exact same dependency set AND the same endorser address, the `maxFeePerGas` and `priorityFeePerGas` of the newly received operation MUST be 12% higher than the one on the mempool to replace it. (Similar with how EOA with same nonce work)

If the `operation` passes these checks, then the client MUST call `isOperationReady()` on the `endorser`. If the endorser considers the operation ready, then the client MUST add the operation to the mempool. Otherwise, the operation MUST discarded.

The `endorser` result MUST be invalidated and its readiness be re-evaluated if any of the values of the provided dependencies change. If the operation readiness changes to `false`, the operation MUST be discarded.

Before including the operation in a block, a last simulation MUST be performed, this time without calling the `endorser`, but by constructing the block and probing the result. All transactions in the block listed **before** the operation must be simulated and the endorser must be queried again there for readiness in-case some dependencies changed.

If the operation fails during simulation, the endorser must be banned because (i) it returned a bad readiness state or (ii) it changed the operation readiness independently from the dependencies.

Additional events that must invalidate the readiness are:

* A transaction or operation modifies the same storage slots (as the dependencies) is queued before the given operation.

#### Optional rules
Mempool clients could implement additional rules to further protect against maliciously constructed transactions.
* Limit the size of accepted dependencies to `MAX_OPERATION_DEPENDENCIES`, dropping operations that cross the boundary.
* Limit the number of times an operation may trigger a re-evaluation to `MAX_OPERATION_REEVALS`, dropping operations that cross the boundary.
* Limit the number of operations in the mempool that depend on the same dependency slots.

If these rules are widely adopted, wallet developers should keep usage of dependencies to the lowest possible levels.

#### Evaluation
To evaluate an `operation`, the client must call the `isOperationReady` method, with a `gasLimit` above or equal to `endorserGasLimit`.

If the call fails, or the `endorser` returns `ready == false`, then the operation must be dropped from the mempool.

If the call succeeds and returns `ready == true`, then the operation can be kept in the mempool and used when constructing the next block. The client must keep track of all fields returned as `dependencies`. If any of these register a change, then readiness should be reevaluated.


#### After operation inclusion
There is no limit in-place that defines that an operation can only be executed once.

The bundler MUST NOT drop an `operation` after successfully including such operation in a block, the `operation` must remain in the mempool and a last `isOperationReady` call must be performed.

If the `endorser` still returns `readiness == true` (after inclusion) then the operation SHOULD be treated as any other healthy operation, and thus it COULD be kept in the mempool.

### Endorser registry
The endorser registry serves as a place to register the burn of each endorser, anyone can increase the burn of any endorser by calling the `addBurn` function.

All burn is effectively locked forever; slashing can't be reliably proved on-chain without protocol alterations, so it remains a virtual event on which mempool operators will ignore the deposited ETH.

#### Implementation
(EXAMPLE)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.15;


contract EndorserRegistry {
  event Burned(
      address indexed _endorser,
      address indexed _sender,
      uint256 _new,
      uint256 _total
  );

  mapping(address => uint256) public burn;

  function addBurn(address _endorser) external payable returns (uint256) {
    uint256 total = burn[_endorser] + msg.value;
    burn[_endorser] = total;

    emit Burned(_endorser, msg.sender, msg.value, total);

    return total;
  }
}
```

## Rationale
The main challenge with a purely smart contract wallet-based account abstraction system is DoS safety: how can a bundler that includes an operation make sure that it will pay fees without executing the entire operation?

Bundlers could execute the entire operation to determine if it is healthy or not, but this operation may be expensive and complex for the following reasons:

* The bundler does not have a way to simulate the transaction with a reduced amount of gas; it has to use the whole `gasLimit`, exposing itself to a higher level of griefing.
* The bundler does not have a way to know if a change to the state will affect the operation or not, and thus it has to re-evaluate the operation after every single change.
* The bundler does not have a way to know if a change to the state will invalidate a large portion of the mempool.

In this proposal, we add the `endorser` as a tool for the bundlers to validate arbitrary operations in a controlled manner, without the bundler having to know any of the inner workings of such operation.

In effect, we move the responsibility from the wallet to the wallet developer; the developer must code, deploy and burn ETH for the `endorser`; this is a nearly ideal scenario because developers know how their wallet operations work, and thus they can build tools to evaluate these operations efficiently.

Additionally, the specification is kept as simple as possible as enforcing a highly structured behavior and schema for smart contract wallet transactions may stagnate the adoption of more innovative types of wallets and the adoption of a shared standard among them.

#### Differences with alternative proposals
1) This proposal does not require monitoring for forbidden opcodes or storage access boundaries. Wallets have complete freedom to use any EVM capabilities during validation and execution.
2) This proposal does not specify any replay protection logic since all existing smart contract wallets already have their own, and designs can vary among them. Nonces can be communicated to the bundler using a `dependency`.
3) This proposal does not specify a pre-deployment logic because it can be handled directly by the entrypoint.
4) This proposal does not require wallets to accept `execution` transactions from a trusted entrypoint contract, reducing overhead and allowing existing wallets to be compatible with the proposal.
5) This proposal does not distinguish between `execution` and `signature` payloads, this distinction remains implementation-specific.


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP does not change he consensus layer, nor does impose changes on existing smart contract wallets, so there are no backwards compatibility issues.
