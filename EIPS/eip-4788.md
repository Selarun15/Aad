## Abstract

Commit to the hash tree root of each beacon chain block in the corresponding execution payload header.

Store each of these roots in a stateful precompile.

## Motivation

Roots of the beacon chain blocks are cryptographic accumulators that allow proofs of arbitrary consensus state.
Exposing these roots inside the EVM allows for trust-minimized access to the consensus layer.
This functionality supports a wide variety of use cases that improve trust assumptions of staking pools,
restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, MEV mitigations and more.

### Background

The high-level idea is that each execution block contains the parent beacon block root. Even in the event of missed slots since the previous block root does not change,
we only need a constant amount of space to represent this "oracle" in each execution block. To improve the usability of this oracle, a small history of block roots
are stored in a stateful precompile.
To bound the amount of storage this construction consumes, a ring buffer is used that mirrors a block root accumulator on the consensus layer.

### Block structure and validity

Beginning at the execution timestamp `FORK_TIMESTAMP`, execution clients **MUST** extend the header schema with an additional field: the `parent_beacon_block_root`.
This root consumes 32 bytes and is exactly the [hash tree root](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/fa09d896484bbe240334fa21ffaa454bafe5842e/ssz/simple-serialize.md#merkleization) of the parent beacon block for the given execution block.

The resulting RLP encoding of the header is therefore:

```python
rlp([
    parent_hash,
    0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347, # ommers hash
    coinbase,
    state_root,
    txs_root,
    receipts_root,
    logs_bloom,
    0, # difficulty
    number,
    gas_limit,
    gas_used,
    timestamp,
    extradata,
    prev_randao,
    0x0000000000000000, # nonce
    base_fee_per_gas,
    withdrawals_root,
    data_gas_used,
    excess_data_gas,
    parent_beacon_block_root,
])
```

Validity of the parent beacon block root is guaranteed from the consensus layer, much like how withdrawals are handled.

When verifying a block, execution clients **MUST** ensure the root value in the block header matches the one provided by the consensus client.

### EVM changes

#### Block processing

At the start of processing any execution block where `block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP` (i.e. before processing any transactions),
write the parent beacon root provided in the block header into the storage of the contract at `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS`.

In order to bound the storage used by this precompile, two ring buffers are used: one to track the latest timestamp at a given index in the ring buffer and another to track
the latest root at a given index.

To derive the index `timestamp_index` into the timestamp ring buffer, the timestamp (a 64-bit unsigned integer value) is reduced modulo `HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS`.
To derive the index `root_index` into the root ring buffer, add `HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS` to the index into the timestamp ring buffer.
Both resulting 64-bit unsigned integers should be encoded as 32 bytes in big-endian format when writing to the storage.

The timestamp from the header, encoded as 32 bytes in big-endian format, is the value to write behind the `timestamp_index`.
The 32 bytes of the `parent_beacon_block_root` (as provided) are the value to write behind the `root_index`.

In Python pseudocode:

```python
timestamp_reduced = block_header.timestamp % HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS
timestamp_extended = timestamp_reduced + HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS
timestamp_index = to_uint256_be(timestamp_reduced)
root_index = to_uint256_be(timestamp_extended)

timestamp_as_uint256 = to_uint256_be(block_header.timestamp)
parent_beacon_block_root = block_header.parent_beacon_block_root

sstore(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, timestamp_index, timestamp_as_uint256)
sstore(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, root_index, parent_beacon_block_root)
```

#### New stateful precompile

Beginning at the execution timestamp `FORK_TIMESTAMP`, a "stateful" precompile is deployed at `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS`.

Callers of the precompile should provide the `timestamp` they are querying encoded as 32 bytes in big-endian format.
Clients **MUST** sanitize this input call data to the precompile.
If the input is _more_ than 32 bytes, the precompile only takes the first 32 bytes of the input buffer and ignores the rest.
If the input is _less_ than 32 bytes, the precompile should revert.

Given this input, the precompile reduces the `timestamp` in the same way during the write routine and first checks if
the `timestamp` recorded in the ring buffer matches the one supplied by the caller.

If the `timestamp` **does NOT** match, the client **MUST** return the "zero" word -- the 32-byte value where each byte is `0x00`.

If the `timestamp` **does** match, the client **MUST** read the root from the contract storage and return those 32 bytes in the caller's return buffer.

In pseudocode:

```python
timestamp = evm.calldata[:32]
if len(timestamp) != 32:
    evm.revert()
    return

timestamp_reduced = to_uint64_be(timestamp) % HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS
timestamp_index = to_uint256_be(timestamp_reduced)

recorded_timestamp = sload(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, timestamp_index)
if recorded_timestamp != timestamp:
    evm.returndata[:32].set(uint256(0))
else:
    timestamp_extended = timestamp_reduced + HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS
    root_index = to_uint256_be(timestamp_extended)
    root = sload(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, root_index)
    evm.returndata[:32].set(root)
```

The precompile costs `G_beacon_root` gas to reflect the two (2) implicit `SLOAD`s from the precompile's state.

## Rationale

### Gas cost of precompile

The suggested gas cost reflects a cold `SLOAD` analogous to the operation(s) performed while executing the precompile's logic.

### Why not repurpose `BLOCKHASH`?

The `BLOCKHASH` opcode could be repurposed to provide the beacon root instead of some execution block hash.
To minimize code change, avoid breaking changes to smart contracts, and simplify deployment to mainnet, this EIP suggests leaving `BLOCKHASH` alone and adding a new precompile with the desired semantics.

### Beacon block root instead of state root

Block roots are preferred over state roots so there is a constant amount of work to do with each new execution block. Otherwise, skipped slots would require
a linear amount of work with each new payload. While skipped slots are quite rare on mainnet, it is best to not add additional load under what would already
be nonfavorable conditions.

Use of block root over state root does mean proofs will require a few additional nodes but this cost is negligible (and could be amortized across all consumers,
e.g. with a singleton state root contract that caches the proof per slot).

### Why two ring buffers?

The first ring buffer only tracks `HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS` worth of roots and so for all possible timestamp values would consume a constant amount of storage.
However, this design opens the precompile to an attack where a skipped slot that has the same value modulo the ring buffer length would return an old root value,
rather than the most recent one.

To nullify this attack while retaining a fixed memory footprint, this EIP keeps track of the pair of data `(parent_beacon_block_root, timestamp)` for each index into the
ring buffer and verifies the timestamp matches the one originally used to write the root data when being read. Given the fixed size of storage slots (only 32 bytes), the requirement
to store a pair of values necessitates two ring buffers, rather than just one.

### Size of ring buffers

The ring buffer data structures are sized to hold 8192 roots from the consensus layer at current slot timings (`SECONDS_PER_SLOT` is 12 seconds on mainnet, and `8192 * 12 == 98304`).
At mainnet values, 8192 roots provides about a day of coverage of the chain which gives users plenty of time to make a transaction with a verification against a given root in
the chain and get the transaction included.
