## Abstract

This proposal standardizes smart contract accounts and account plugins, which are smart contract interfaces that allow for composable logic within smart contract accounts. This proposal is compliant with [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md), and takes inspiration from [ERC-2535](./eip-2535.md) when defining interfaces for updating and querying modular function implementations.

This modular approach splits account functionality into three categories, implements them in external contracts, and defines an expected execution flow from accounts.

## Motivation

One of the goals that ERC-4337 accomplishes is abstracting the logic for execution and validation to each smart contract account.

Many new features of accounts can be built by customizing the logic that goes into the validation and execution steps. Examples of such features include session keys, subscriptions, spending limits, and role-based access control. Currently, some of these features are implemented natively by specific smart contract accounts, and others are able to be implemented by plugin systems. Examples of proprietary plugin systems include Safe modules and ZeroDev plugins.

However, managing multiple account instances provides a worse user experience, fragmenting accounts across supported features and security configurations. Additionally, it requires plugin developers to choose which platforms to support, causing either platform lock-in or duplicated development effort.

We propose a standard that coordinates the implementation work between plugin developers and wallet developers. This standard defines a modular smart contract account capable of supporting all standard-conformant plugins. This allows users to have greater portability of their data, and for plugin developers to not have to choose specific account implementations to support.

![diagram showing relationship between accounts and plugins of each type](../assets/eip-6900/MSCA_Shared_Components_Diagram.svg)

We take inspiration from ERC-2535’s diamond pattern for routing execution based on function selectors, and create a similarly composable account. However, the standard does not require the multi-facet proxy pattern.

These plugins can contain execution logic, validation schemes, and hooks. Validation schemes define the circumstances under which the smart contract account will approve actions taken on its behalf, while hooks allow for pre- and post-execution controls.

Accounts adopting this standard will support modular, upgradable execution and validation logic. Defining this as a standard for smart contract accounts will make plugins easier to develop securely and will allow for greater interoperability.

Goals:

- Provide standards for how validation, execution, and hook functions for smart contract accounts should be written.
- Provide standards for how compliant accounts should add, update, remove, and inspect plugins.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Terms

- An **account** (or **smart contract account, SCA**) is a smart contract that can be used to send transactions and hold digital assets. It implements the `IAccount` interface from ERC-4337.
- A **modular account** (or **modular smart contract account, MSCA**) is an account that supports modular functions. There are three types of modular functions:
  - **Validation functions** validate the caller’s authenticity and authority to the account.
  - **Execution functions** execute any custom logic allowed by the account.
  - **Hooks** execute custom logic and checks before and/or after an execution function.
- A **validation function** is a function that validates authentication and authorization of a caller to the account. There are two types of validation functions:
  - **User Operation Validator** functions handle calls to `validateUserOp` and check the validity of an ERC-4337 user operation. The function may have any function name, and MUST take in the parameters `(UserOperation calldata, bytes32)`, representing the user operation and user operation hash. It MUST return `(uint256)`, representing packed validation data for `authorizer`, `validUntil`, and `validAfter`.
  - **Runtime Validator** functions run before an execution function when not called via a user operation, and enforce checks. Common checks include allowing execution only by an owner.
- An **execution function** is a smart contract function that defines the main execution step of a function for a **modular account**.
- The **standard execute functions** are two specific execution functions that are implemented natively by the modular account, and not on a plugin. These allow for open-ended execution.
- A **hook** is a smart contract function executed before or after another function, with the ability to modify state or cause the entire call to revert. There are four types of **hooks**.
  - **Pre User Operation Validation Hook** functions run before user operation validators. These can enforce permissions on what actions a validator may perform via user operations.
  - **Pre Runtime Validation Hook** functions run before runtime validators. These can enforce permissions on what actions a validator may perform via direct calls.
  - **Pre Execution Hook** functions run before an **execution function**. They may optionally return data to be consumed the **postHook**.
  - **Post Execution Hook** functions run after an **execution function**. They may optionally take returned data from **preHook**.
- **Associated function** refers to either a validation function or a hook.
- A **plugin** is a deployed smart contract that hosts any amount of the above three kinds of modular functions: execution functions, validation functions, or hooks.

### Overview

A modular account handles two kinds of calls: either from the `Entrypoint` through ERC-4337, or through direct calls from externally owned accounts (EOAs) and other smart contracts. This standard supports both use cases.

A call to the smart contract account can be decomposed into 5 steps as shown in the diagram below. The validation steps (Steps 1 and 2) validate if the caller is allowed to call. The pre execution hook step (Step 3) can be used to do any pre execution checks or updates. It can also be used with the post execution hook step (Step 5) to perform additional actions or verification. The execution step (Step 4) performs a defined task or collection of tasks.

![diagram showing execution flow within an account](../assets/eip-6900/MSCA_Two_Call_Paths_Diagram.svg)

Each step is modular, supporting different implementations for each execution function, and composable, supporting multiple steps through hooks. Combined, these allow for open-ended programmable accounts.

### Interfaces

Modular Smart Contract Accounts MUST implement the `IAccount` interface from [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md).

#### Common types

The following types are used by both of the following interfaces. Implementors MAY use the elementary value type instead of the type alias.

```solidity
type FunctionReference is bytes24;

type HookGroupId is uint32;
```

Variables of the type `FunctionReference` MUST be interpreted as an address in the first 20 bytes and a function selector in the remaining 4 bytes.

#### `IPluginUpdate.sol`

Plugin modification interface. Modular Smart Contract Accounts MAY implement this interface to support updates to plugins.

```solidity
interface IPluginUpdate {
    enum PluginAction {
        ADD,
        REPLACE,
        REMOVE
    }

    enum ValidatorType {
        USER_OP_VALIDATOR,
        RUNTIME_VALIDATOR
    }

    enum HookType {
        PRE_EXEC_HOOK,
        POST_EXEC_HOOK,
        PRE_USER_OP_VALIDATION_HOOK,
        PRE_RUNTIME_VALIDATION_HOOK
    }

    struct ExecutionUpdate {
        PluginAction action;
        address pluginAddress;
        bytes4[] executionSelectors;
        ValidatorUpdate[] validatorUpdates;
    }

    struct ValidatorUpdate {
        PluginAction action;
        ValidatorType validatorType;
        FunctionReference functionReference;
    }

    struct HookGroupUpdate {
        PluginAction action;
        HookGroupId hookGroupId;
        bytes4[] executionSelectors;
    }

    struct HookUpdate {
        PluginAction action;
        HookGroupId hookGroupId;
        HookType hookType;
        FunctionReference functionReference;
    }

    event ExecutionPluginUpdate(ExecutionUpdate[] executionUpdates);

    function updatePlugins(
        ExecutionUpdate[] calldata executionUpdates,
        HookUpdate[] calldata hookUpdates,
        HookGroupUpdate[] calldata hookGroupUpdates,
        address init,
        bytes calldata callData
    ) external;
}
```

#### `IPluginLoupe.sol`

Plugin inspection interface. Modular Smart Contract Accounts MAY implement this interface to support visibility in plugin configuration on-chain.

```solidity
interface IPluginLoupe {
    struct ExecutionPluginConfig {
        address executionPluginAddress;
        HookGroupId[] hookGroupIds;
        HookGroup[] hookGroups;
        FunctionReference userOpValidator;
        FunctionReference runtimeValidator;
    }

    struct HookGroup {
        FunctionReference preUserOpValidation;
        FunctionReference preRuntimeValidation;
        FunctionReference preExec;
        FunctionReference postExec;
    }

    function getExecutionFunctionConfig(bytes4 executionSelector)
        external
        view
        returns (ExecutionPluginConfig memory);

    function getStandardExecutionValidators()
        external
        view
        returns (FunctionReference[] memory userOpValidators, FunctionReference[] memory runtimeValidators);
}
```

#### `IStandardExecutor.sol`

Standard execution interface. Modular Smart Contract Accounts MUST implement this interface to support open-ended execution.

```solidity
interface IStandardExecutor {

    enum ExecutionMode {
        CALL,
        DELEGATECALL,
        STATICCALL
    }

    struct Execution {
        address target;
        uint256 value;
        bytes data;
        ExecutionMode mode;
    }

    function execute(address dest, uint256 value, bytes calldata func, ExecutionMode mode, FunctionReference validator)
        external
        payable;

    function executeBatch(Execution[] calldata executions, FunctionReference validator) external payable;
}
```

### Expected behavior

#### Calls to `updatePlugins`

The function `updatePlugins` takes in arrays of execution updates, hook updates, and hook group updates to perform. It also takes in an optional initialization function. The function MUST perform the update operation sequentially, then, if the address provided in `init` is not `address(0)`, MUST execute `init` with the calldata `callData` through a `delegatecall`.

> **⚠️ The ability to update a plugin is very powerful. The security of the updatePlugins determines the security of the account. It is critical for modular account implementers to make sure updatePlugins has the proper security consideration and access control in place.**

#### Calls to `validateUserOp`

When the function `validateUserOp` is called on modular account by the `EntryPoint`, it MUST find the user operation validator defined for the selector in `userOp.callData`, which is in the first four bytes. If there is no function defined for the selector, or if `userOp.callData.length < 4`, then execution MUST revert. Otherwise, the MSCA MUST execute the validator function with the user operation and its hash as parameters using the `call` opcode. The returned validation data from the user operation validator MUST be returned by `validateUserOp`.

If the execution selector has associated hook groups with pre user operation validation hooks, then those hooks MUST be run sequentially. If any revert or return false, the outer call MUST revert.

If the call is to a standard execution function, then the modular account must verify that the provided `validator` in calldata has previously been associated with either of the standard execution functions. If it was previously added, the specified user operation validator MUST be run.

#### Calls to execution functions

When a function other than a natively defined function is called on an MSCA, it MUST find the plugin configuration for the corresponding selector added via `updatePlugins`. If no corresponding plugin is found, the MSCA MUST revert. Otherwise, the MSCA MUST perform the following steps:

- If the call is not from the `EntryPoint`, then find an associated `runtimeValidator` function. If one does not exist, execution MUST revert. The modular account MUST execute all pre runtime validation hooks, then the runtime validator function, with the `call` opcode. All of these functions MUST receive the caller, value, and execution function’s calldata as parameters. If any of these functions revert, or return a boolean false, execution MUST revert.
- If there are pre execution hooks defined in the associated hook groups of the execution function, execute those hooks with the caller, value, and execution function’s calldata as parameters. If any of thee hooks returns data, it MUST be preserved until the call to the post execution hook. The operation must be done with the `call` opcode.
- Run the execution function.
- If any associated post execution hooks are defined, run the functions. If a pre execution hook in the same hook group returned data to the account, that data MUST be passed as a parameter to the post execution hook. The operation must be done with the `call` opcode.

> **⚠️ If the execution function does not have a definition for either pre runtime validation hooks, pre execution hooks or post execution hooks, the undefined functions will be skipped. The execution function will be run and it may change account state.**

#### Plugin update operations

When `updatePlugins` is called with `PluginAction.ADD`, the following MUST occur:

- Each execution selector must be added as a valid execution function, with the contract specified in `pluginAddress` as implementation contract to call to.
- Each validator function reference must be added to their parent execution function in the role specified by `validatorType`.
- Each hook update must add the hook type specified by `hookType` to the group specified by `hookGroupId`. If that hook type is already defined, the update MUST revert.
- Each hook group update must add that hook group to the execution selectors specified by `executionSelectors`.

Execution function selectors MUST be unique when added.

When `updatePlugins` is called with `PluginAction.REPLACE`, each each execution selector or function reference MUST override any previous definition for said function. Existing associated functions not specified in this operation MUST NOT be modified.

When `updatePlugins` is called with `PluginAction.REMOVE`, execution function definitions and associated function definitions MUST be removed.

#### Plugin Functions

Execution functions may have any function signature, but must be unique for the account. When added to an MSCA via `updatePlugins`, the function selector of the execution function will be mapped from the modular account to the plugin.

User Operation Validation functions may have any function name, and MUST take in the parameters `(UserOperation calldata, bytes32)`, representing the user operation and the user operation hash. The functions MUST return `(uint256)`, representing packed validation data for `authorizer`, `validUntil`, and `validAfter`.

Here is an example function signature of a conformant user operation validator function:

```solidity
function validateSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash) external returns (uint256 validationData);
```

Runtime Validation Functions may have any function name, and MUST take in the parameters `(address, uint256, bytes calldata)`.

Here is an example function signature of a conformant runtime validator function:

```solidity
function validateOwnership(address caller, uint256 value, bytes calldata) external;
```

Hooks MAY have any function name.
The pre user operation validation hook functions MUST take in the parameters `(bytes calldata callData, bytes calldata paymasterAndData)` and return `(bool)`.
The pre runtime validation hook functions MUST take in the parameters `(bytes calldata)` and return `(bool)`.
The pre execution hook functions MUST take in the parameters `(address, uint256, bytes calldata)` and return `(bytes calldata)`.
The post execution hook functions MUST take in the parameters `(bytes calldata)`.

## Rationale

ERC-4337 compatible accounts must implement the `IAccount` interface, which consists of only one method that bundles validation with execution: `validateUserOp`. A primary design rationale for this proposal is to extend the possible functions for a smart contract account beyond this single method by unbundling these and other functions, while retaining the benefits of account abstraction.

The diamond pattern of ERC-2535 is the logical starting point for achieving this extension into multiple functionality, given its suitability for implementing multiple execution calls to ERC-4337 compatible accounts from EntryPoint. It also meets our other primary design rationale of generalizability to calls to EOA/SC accounts. However, a strict diamond pattern is constrained by its inability to customize validation schemes and other logic linked to specific execution functions in the context of `validateUserOp`.

This proposal includes several interfaces that build on ERC-4337 and is ispired by ERC-2535. First, we standardize a set of modular plugins that allow smart contract developers greater flexibility in bundling validation, execution and hook logic. We also propose interfaces like `IPluginUpdate` that take inspiration from the diamond standard, and provide methods for updating and querying execution functions, validation schemes, and hooks.

The diamond standard's interfaces are not required or enforced by this standard. An MSCA implementation is considered compliant with this standard as long as it satisfies the interface requirements and expected behaviors.
