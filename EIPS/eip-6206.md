## Abstract

This EIP allows for tail call optimizations in EOF functions ([EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md)) by introducing a new instruction `JUMPF`, which jumps to a code section without adding a new return stack frame.

## Motivation

It is common for functions to make a call at the end of the routine only to then return. `JUMPF` optimizes this behavior by changing code sections without needing to update the return stack.

## Specification

A new instruction, `JUMPF (0xb2)`, is introduced.

### Execution Semantics

1. `JUMPF` has one immediate argument, `code_section_index`, encoded as a 16-bit unsigned big-endian value.
2. If the operand stack size exceeds `1024 - type[code_section_index].max_stack_height` (i.e. if the called function may exceed the global stack height limit), execution results in an exceptional halt. This guarantees that the stack height after the call is within the limits.
3. `JUMPF` costs 5 gas.
4. `JUMPF` neither pops nor pushes anything to the operand stack.

### Code Validation

Let the definition of `type[i]` be inherited from [EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md) and define `stack_height` to be the height of the stack at a certain instruction during the instruction flow traversal if the operand stack at the start of the function were equal to `type[i].inputs`.

* The immediate argument of `JUMPF` MUST be less than the total number of code sections.
* For each `JUMPF` instruction `type[current_section_index].outputs` MUST be greater or equal `type[code_section_index].outputs`.
* The stack height at `JUMPF` MUST be equal to `type[current_section_index].outputs + type[code_section_index].inputs  - type[code_section_index].outputs`. This means that `code_section_index` can output less stack elements than the original code section called by the top element on the return stack, if the `current_section_index` code section leaves the delta `type[current_section_index].outputs - type[code_section_index].outputs` element(s) on the stack.
* The code validation defined in [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md) also fails if any `RJUMP*` offset points to one of the two bytes directly following a `JUMPF` instruction.

## Rationale

### Allowing `JUMPF` to section with less outputs

As long as `JUMPF` prepares the delta `type[current_section_index].outputs - type[code_section_index].outputs` stack elements before changing code sections, it is possible to jump to a section with less outputs than was originally entered via `CALLF`. This will reduce duplicated code as it will allow compilers more flexibility during code generation such that certain helpers can be used generically by functions, regardless of their output values.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is backward compatible as EOF does not allow undefined instructions to be used or deployed, meaning no contracts will be affected.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.
