## Abstract

This standard is an extension of [EIP-721](./eip-721.md). It proposes some additional functions (`startTime`, `endTime`) to help with on-chain time management.

## Motivation

Some NFTs have a defined usage period and cannot be used outside of that period. With traditional NFTs that do not include time information, if you want to mark a token as invalid or enable it at a specific time, you need to actively submit a transactionâ€”a process both cumbersome and expensive.

Some existing NFTs contain time functions, but their interfaces are not consistent, so it is difficult to develop third-party platforms for them.

By introducing these functions (`startTime`, `endTime`), it is possible to enable and disable NFTs automatically on chain.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev the EIP-165 identifier for this interface is 0x7a0cdf92.
 */
interface IERC5007 /* is IERC721 */ {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the start time of the NFT as a UNIX timestamp.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `tokenId` must exist.
     */
    function startTime(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (int64);
    
    /**
     * @dev Returns the end time of the NFT as a UNIX timestamp.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `tokenId` must exist.
     */
    function endTime(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (int64);

}
```

The **composable extension** is OPTIONAL for this standard. This allows your NFT to be minted from an existing NFT or to merge two NFTs into one NFT.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev the EIP-165 identifier for this interface is 0x620063db.
 */
interface IERC5007Composable /* is IERC5007 */ {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the ancestor token id of the NFT.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `tokenId` must exist.
     */
    function rootTokenId(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev  Mint a new token from an old token.
     * The rootTokenId of the new token is the same as the rootTokenId of the old token
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `oldTokenId` must exist.
     * - `newTokenId` must not exist.
     * - `newTokenOwner` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `newTokenStartTime`  require(oldTokenStartTime < newTokenStartTime && newTokenStartTime <= oldTokenEndTime)
     */
    function split(
        uint256 oldTokenId,
        uint256 newTokenId,
        address newTokenOwner,
        int64 newTokenStartTime
    ) external;

    /**
     * @dev  Merge the first token and second token into the new token.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `firstTokenId` must exist.
     * - `secondTokenId` must exist. require((firstToken.endTime + 1) == secondToken.startTime)
     * - `newTokenOwner` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `newTokenId` must not exist.
     */
    function merge(
        uint256 firstTokenId,
        uint256 secondTokenId,
        address newTokenOwner,
        uint256 newTokenId
    ) external;
}
```

## Rationale

### Time Data Type

The max value of `int64` is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. As a timestamp, 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 is about year 292,471,210,648. `uint256` is too big for C, C++, Java, Go, etc, and `int64` is natively supported by mainstream programming languages.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully EIP-721 compatible.

## Test Cases

Test cases are included in [test.js](../assets/eip-5007/test/test.js). 

Run in terminal:

```shell
cd ../assets/eip-5007
npm install
truffle test
```
