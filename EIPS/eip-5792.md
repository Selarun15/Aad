## Abstract

Defines new JSON-RPC methods which enable apps to ask a wallet to process a batch of onchain write calls and to check on the status of those calls. Calls can be specified to make use of various wallet-defined capabilities, and there is also a new RPC to enable apps to discover which capabilities a wallet supports. 

## Motivation

The current methods used to send transactions from the user wallet and check their status are `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.

The current methods used to send transactions from the user wallet and check their status do not meet modern developer demands and cannot accomodate new transaction formats. Even the name–`eth_sendTransaction`–is an artifact of a time when nodes served as wallets. 

Today, developers want to send batch transactions, which many smart accounts can support atomically. Developers also want to make use of features afforded by new transaction formats, like paymasters in [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) transactions. `eth_sendTransaction` offers no way to do these things. 

In updating to a new set of `wallet_` RPCs, our main goals are to enforce a clean separation of wallet and app concerns, enable developers to make use of things like paymasters and batch transactions, and to create a clear way for more features to be added over time with minimal coordination.

## Specification

Four new JSON-RPC methods are added. Apps may begin using these methods immediately, falling back to `eth_sendTransaction` and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` when they are not available.

We define one capability related to call execution atomicity.

### `wallet_getCapabilities`

RPC for an application to receive information about the capabilities that a provided wallet supports (e.g. batch transactions, paymaster communication).

This method SHOULD return an error if the user has not already approved a connection to the app with the provided address.

The key of each item per chain is the name of a capability and the value can be of any shape. Capabilities are returned per chain because wallets may support different capabilities across chains.

We expect the community to align on the definition of capabilities in separate ERCs.

#### `wallet_getCapabilities` RPC Specification

```typescript
type GetCapabilitiesParams = [`0x${string}`]; // Wallet address

type GetCapabilitiesResult = Record<`0x${string}`, <Record<string, any>>; // Hex chain id
```

##### `wallet_getCapabilities` Example Parameters

```json
["0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567"]
```

##### `wallet_getCapabilities` Example Return Value

The capabilities below are for illustrative purposes.

```json
{
  "0x2105": {
    "paymasterService": {
      "supported": true
    },
    "sessionKeys": {
      "supported": true
    }
  },
  "0x14A34": {
    "paymasterService": {
      "supported": true
    }
  }
}
```

### `wallet_sendCalls`

Requests that a wallet submits a batch of calls. From and chain ID are top level because all calls should be sent from the same sender on the same chain. The items in the calls field are only those that are shared by all transaction types. Any other fields that a wallet may need to submit a transaction should be handled by the wallet. 

The capabilities field is how an app can communicate with a wallet about capabilities a wallet supports. For example, this is where an app can specify a paymaster service URL from which an [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) wallet can request a `paymasterAndData` input for a user operation.

The wallet:

* MUST send these calls in the order specified in the request.
* MUST send the calls on the request chain ID.
* MUST NOT send any calls from the request if the user rejects the request
* MAY revert all calls if any call fails
* MAY send all the function calls as part of one transaction or multiple transactions, depending on wallet capability.
* SHOULD stop executing the calls if any call fails
* MAY reject the request if the request chain ID does not match the currently selected chain ID.
* MAY reject the request if the from address does not match the enabled account.
* MAY reject the request if one or more calls in the batch is expected to fail, when simulated sequentially

#### `wallet_sendCalls` RPC Specification

```typescript
type SendCallsParams = {
  version: string;
  chainId: `0x${string}`; // Hex chain id
  from: `0x${string}`;
  calls: {
    to?: `0x${string}` | undefined;
    data?: `0x${string}` | undefined;
    value?: `0x${string}` | undefined; // Hex value
  }[];
  capabilities?: Record<string, any> | undefined;
};

type SendCallsResult = string;
```

##### `wallet_sendCalls` Example Parameters

```json
[
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "chainId": "0x01",
    "from": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
    "calls": [
      {
        "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
        "value": "0x9184e72a",
        "data": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"
      },
      {
        "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
        "value": "0x182183",
        "data": "0xfbadbaf01"
      }
    ],
    "capabilities": {
      // Illustrative
      "paymasterService": {
        "url": "https://..."
      }
    }
  }
]
```

##### `wallet_sendCalls` Example Return Value

The identifier can be any string. The only requirement is that for a given session, users should be able to call `wallet_getCallsStatus` with this value and get a call batch status.

```json
"0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
```

### `wallet_getCallsStatus`

Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via `wallet_sendCalls`. The identifier of the transaction is the value returned from the `wallet_sendCalls` RPC. Note this method only returns a subset of fields that `eth_getTransactionReceipt` returns, excluding any fields that may differ across wallet implementations.

* If a wallet does not execute multiple calls atomically (i.e. in multiple transactions), the receipts in the `receipts` field MUST be in order of the calls sent.
* If a wallet executes multiple calls atomically (i.e. in a single transaction), `wallet_getCallsStatus` MUST return a single receipt, corresponding to the transaction in which the calls were included.
* The `logs` in the receipt objects MUST only include logs relevant to the calls submitted using `wallet_sendCalls`. For example, in the case of a transaction submitted onchain by an [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) bundler, the logs must only include those relevant to the user operation constructed using the calls submitted via `wallet_sendCalls`. I.e. the logs should not include those from other unrelated user operations submitted in the same bundle.

#### `wallet_getCallsStatus` RPC Specification

```typescript
type GetCallsParams = string;

type GetCallsResult = {
  status: 'PENDING' | 'CONFIRMED';
  receipts?: {
    logs: {
      address: `0x${string}`;
      data: `0x${string}`;
      topics: `0x${string}`[];
    }[];
    status: `0x${string}`; // Hex 1 or 0 for success or failure, respectively
    blockHash: `0x${string}`;
    blockNumber: `0x${string}`;
    gasUsed: `0x${string}`;
    transactionHash: `0x${string}`;
  }[];
};
```

##### `wallet_getCallsStatus` Example Parameters

As with the return value of `wallet_sendCalls`, the batch identifier may be any string.

```json
[
  "0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
]
```

##### `wallet_getCallsStatus` Example Return Value

```json
{
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "receipts": [
    {
      "logs": [
        {
          "address": "0xa922b54716264130634d6ff183747a8ead91a40b",
          "topics": [
            "0x5a2a90727cc9d000dd060b1132a5c977c9702bb3a52afe360c9c22f0e9451a68"
          ],
          "data": "0xabcd"
        }
      ],
      "status": "0x1",
      "blockHash": "0xf19bbafd9fd0124ec110b848e8de4ab4f62bf60c189524e54213285e7f540d4a",
      "blockNumber": "0xabcd",
      "gasUsed": "0xdef",
      "transactionHash": "0x9b7bb827c2e5e3c1a0a44dc53e573aa0b3af3bd1f9f5ed03071b100bb039eaff"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `wallet_showCallsStatus`

Requests that a wallet shows information about a given call bundle that was sent with `wallet_sendCalls`. Note that this method does not return anything.

#### `wallet_showCallsStatus` RPC Specification

```typescript
type ShowCallsParams = string; // Call bundle identifier returned by wallet_sendCalls
```

##### `wallet_showCallsStatus` Example Parameters

This method accepts a call bundle identifier returned by a `wallet_sendCalls` call.

```json
[
  "0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331"
]
```

### `atomicBatch` Capability

Indicates that a wallet can execute multiple calls atomically as part of a single transaction.

If a wallet indicates it supports the `atomicBatch` capability, it MUST submit calls submitted with `wallet_sendCalls` as part of a single transaction.

#### `atomicBatch` Capaiblity Specification

```typescript
type AtomicBatchCapability = {
  supported: true;
};
```

##### `wallet_getCapabilities` Example Return Value

For each chain on which a wallet can submit multiple calls atomically, the wallet SHOULD include an `atomicBatch` capability with a `supported` field equal to `true`.

```json
{
  "0x2105": {
    "atomicBatch": {
      "supported": true
    },
  },
  "0x14A34": {
    "atomicBatch": {
      "supported": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Rationale

### On Naming

We considered modifying `eth_sendTransaction` to add support for these new capabilities, but the method is ultimately an artifact of when nodes were used to sign transactions. We decided it is better to move forward with `wallet` namespaced methods that better describe what they are used for.

We also debated on if the methods should be called `wallet_sendTransaction`, `wallet_sendCalls`, or something else. We ultimately landed on `wallet_sendCalls` because in the case of EOA wallets the `wallet_send*` method might send more than one transaction. Similarly, we decided against `wallet_sendTransactions` because in the case of other wallet implementations (e.g. [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md)) multiple calls could result in a single transaction.

### Call Execution Atomicity

The `wallet_sendCalls` method accepts an array of `calls`. However, this proposal does not require that these calls are executed as part of a single transaction. This is so that EOA wallets can accept multiple calls too. That said, we expect that app developers might want to only submit batched calls if and only if they are executed atomically. This would reduce the number of error cases an app developer would need to handle.

We initially proposed that multiple calls must be executed atomically, but after some debate we ultimately decided this was too opinionated. Instead, we are including a specification for an `atomicBatch` capability. This allows for EOA wallets to accept multiple calls and still gives developers the option to only submit batched calls if they are executed atomically.

### Call Gas Limit

Our initial proposal included an optional `gas` field for each call in the `calls` field accepted by the `walletSendCalls` method. However, we realized this could be misleading because in the case of [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) wallets you cannot specify a gas limit per call, only a single gas limit for all calls in the user operation. We then proposed a single `gas` value that would apply to all of the calls. This works for [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) wallets, but not for EOA wallets. When we decided that EOA wallets should be able to handle multiple calls, we decided to just remove the `gas` field altogether.

## Backwards Compatibility

Wallets that do not support the following methods should return error responses to the new JSON-RPC methods. Apps MAY attempt to send the same batch of calls via `eth_sendTransaction` when they receive a not implemented call, or otherwise indicate to the user that their wallet is not supported.

## Security Considerations

App developers MUST treat each call in a batch as if the call was an independent transaction. In other words, there may be additional untrusted transactions between any of the calls in a batch. The calls in the batch may also be included in separate, non-contiguous blocks. There is no constraint over how long it will take a batch to be included. Apps must encode deadlines in the smart contract calls as they do today. Unless a wallet indicates it can submit batched calls atomically via its capabilities, app developers MUST NOT assume that all calls are sent in a single transaction.
