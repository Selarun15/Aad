## Abstract

The Public Non-Fungible Token Emote Repository standard provides an enhanced interactive utility for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) by allowing NFTs to be emoted at.

This proposal introduces the ability to react to NFTs using Unicode standardized emoji in a public non-gated repository smart contract that is accessible at the same address in all of the networks.

## Motivation

With NFTs being a widespread form of tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem and being used for a variety of use cases, it is time to standardize additional utility for them. Having the ability for anyone to interact with an NFT introduces an interactive aspect to owning an NFT and unlocks feedback-based NFT mechanics.

This ERC introduces new utilities for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) based tokens in the following areas:

- [Interactivity](#interactivity)
- [Feedback based evolution](#feedback-based-evolution)
- [Valuation](#valuation)

### Interactivity

The ability to emote on an NFT introduces the aspect of interactivity to owning an NFT. This can either reflect the admiration for the emoter (person emoting to an NFT) or can be a result of a certain action performed by the token's owner. Accumulating emotes on a token can increase its uniqueness and/or value.

### Feedback based evolution

Standardized on-chain reactions to NFTs allow for feedback based evolution.

Current solutions are either proprietary or off-chain and therefore subject to manipulation and distrust. Having the ability to track the interaction on-chain allows for trust and objective evaluation of a given token. Designing the tokens to evolve when certain emote thresholds are met incentivizes interaction with the token collection.

### Valuation

Current NFT market heavily relies on previous values the token has been sold for, the lowest price of the listed token and the scarcity data provided by the marketplace. There is no real time indication of admiration or desirability of a specific token. Having the ability for users to emote to the tokens adds the possibility of potential buyers and sellers gauging the value of the token based on the impressions the token has collected.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Pre-determined address of the Emotable repository

The address of the Emotable repository smart contract is designed to resemble the function it serves. It starts with `0x311073` which is the abstract representation of `EMOTE`. The address is:

```
0x311073569e12f7770719497cd3b3aa2db0a0c3d9
```

## Rationale

Designing the proposal, we considered the following questions:

1. **Does the proposal support custom emotes or only the Unicode specified ones?**\
The proposal only accepts the Unicode identifier which is a `bytes4` value. This means that while we encourage implementers to add the reactions using standardized emojis, the values not covered by the Unicode standard can be used for custom emotes. The only drawback being that the interface displaying the reactions will have to know what kind of image to render and such additions will probably be limited to the interface or marketplace in which they were made.
2. **Should the proposal use emojis to relay the impressions of NFTs or some other method?**\
The impressions could have been done using user-supplied strings or numeric values, yet we decided to use emojis since they are a well established mean of relaying impressions and emotions.
3. **Should the proposal establish an emotable extension or a common-good repository?**\
Initially we set out to create an emotable extension to be used with any ERC-721 compilant tokens. However, we realized that the proposal would be more useful if it was a common-good repository of emotable tokens. This way, the tokens that can be reacted to are not only the new ones but also the old ones that have been around since before the proposal.\
In line with this decision, we decided to calculate a deterministic address for the repository smart contract. This way, the repository can be used by any NFT collection without the need to search for the address on the given chain.

## Backwards Compatibility

The Emote repository standard is fully compatible with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and with the robust tooling available for implementations of ERC-721 as well as with the existing ERC-721 infrastructure.

## Test Cases

Tests are included in [`emotableRepository.ts`](../assets/eip-6381/test/emotableRepository.ts).

To run them in terminal, you can use the following commands:

```
cd ../assets/eip-6381
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

## Reference Implementation

See [`EmotableRepository.sol`](../assets/eip-6381/contracts/EmotableRepository.sol).

## Security Considerations

The same security considerations as with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) apply: hidden logic may be present in any of the functions, including burn, add asset, accept asset, and more.

Caution is advised when dealing with non-audited contracts.
