## Abstract

We define a formula to derive a location in storage, that is suitable for structs of arbitrary size, from an identifier. The formula is chosen to be safe against collisions with the standard Solidity storage layout. We define a convention to document this location in Solidity source code.

## Motivation

The default Solidity storage layout is linear: all state variables are assigned sequential locations starting from storage slot 0. This is sufficient for most contracts. However, various design patterns used in smart contract development can benefit from a non-linear storage layout. One example is a modular design where using `DELEGATECALL` a contract executes code from multiple contracts, all of which share the same storage space, and which have to carefully coordinate on how to use it. Another example is upgradeable contracts, where it can be difficult to add state variables in an upgrade given that they may affect the assigned storage location for the preexisting variables.

In a non-linear storage layout, instead of being assigned sequential locations starting from slot 0, state variables are spread out across the storage space, usually at pseudorandom locations obtained by hashing. Each value may be placed in an entirely different location, but more frequently values that are used together are put in a Solidity struct and co-located in storage.

These storage usage patterns are invisible to the Solidity compiler because they are not represented as Solidity state variables. Smart contract tools like static analyzers or blockchain explorers often need to know the storage location of contract data. Standardizing the location for non-linear storage layouts will allow these tools to correctly interpret contracts where these design patterns are used.

## Specification

A _namespace_ consists of a set of variables that are placed contiguous in the storage layout of a contract. It should be implemented as a struct.

A _namespace id_ is a string that uniquely identifies a namespace in a contract. It should not contain any whitespace characters.

The storage location for a namespace is defined as `ns_loc(id: string) = keccak256(uint256(keccak256(id)) - 1)`.

A Solidity contract using namespaced storage can annotate a struct with the NatSpec tag `@custom:storage-location erc7201:<NAMESPACE_ID>` to identify it as a namespace with id `<NAMESPACE_ID>`. _(Note: The Solidity compiler includes this annotation in the AST since v0.8.20, so this is recommended as the minimum compiler version when using this pattern.)_

## Rationale

A requirement for the location is that it shouldn't overlap with any storage location that would be used by the standard Solidity layout. This is in case namespaced storage is used alongside standard linear storage, either deliberately or accidentally.

First, note that a namespace may be larger than a single storage slot, so a variable in a namespace will be placed in a slot `ns_loc(id) + k`. If we assume collision resistance of Keccak-256, the chosen `ns_loc` function has the desired property with very high probability, because the cases in which a Solidity variable receives a location of the form `keccak256(x)` are:

1. Dynamic Arrays:
    1. If the array is at the top level and is assigned to storage slot `n`, the location of the `k`th item in the array will be `keccak256(n) + k`, but `n` will be a number much smaller than `uint256(keccak256(id)) - 1`.
    2. If the array is within another array or mapping, it will be in some location `keccak256(x) + j`, and the `k`th item will be at `keccak256(keccak256(x) + j) + k`. For this to equal `ns_loc(x) + k` we would need `j = -1`, but `j` will always be a non-negative number in standard Solidity layout.
2. Mappings: The value for key `q` in a mapping will be at location `keccak256(h(q) . x)` where `x` is the location of the mapping itself, and `h` is as defined in the Solidity documentation (section "Layout of State Variables in Storage"). Note that `h(q)` can be any number of bytes. If it is a non-zero number of bytes, it is distinct from any `ns_loc(id) + k`. If it is zero bytes, it can be that `ns_loc(id) = keccak256(x)` if `x = keccak256(id) - 1`, but we know that `x` is the location of the mapping and (as mentioned for arrays above) a variable will be at `keccak256(y) + j` for a non-negative number `j`.

### Naming

This pattern has sometimes been referred to as "diamond storage". This causes it to be conflated with the "diamond proxy pattern", even though they can be used independently of each other. This EIP has chosen to use a different name to clearly differentiate it from the proxy pattern.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Example {
    /// @custom:storage-location erc7201:example.main
    struct MainStorage {
        uint256 x;
        uint256 y;
    }

    // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("example.main")) - 1));
    bytes32 private constant MAIN_STORAGE_LOCATION =
        0x183a6125c38840424c4a85fa12bab2ab606c4b6d0e7cc73c0c06ba5300eab5da;

    function _getMainStorage() private pure returns (MainStorage storage $) {
        assembly {
            $.slot := MAIN_STORAGE_LOCATION
        }
    }

    function _getXTimesY() internal view returns (uint256) {
        MainStorage storage $ = _getMainStorage();
        return $.x * $.y;
    }
}
```
