## Abstract
This standard is an extension of [EIP-721](./eip-721.md). It proposes two referrable indicators, referring and referred, and a time-based indicator `createdTimestamp`. The relationship between each NFT forms a Directed acyclic graph (DAG). The standard allows users to query, track and analyze their relationships.

## Motivation
Many scenarios require inheritance, reference, and extension of NFTs. For instance, an artist may develop his NFT work based on a previous NFT, or a DJ may remix his record by referring to two pop songs, etc. Proposing a referable solution for existing NFTs and enabling efficient queries on cross-references make much sense.

By adding the `referring` indicator, users can mint new NFTs (e.g., C, D, E) by referring to existing NFTs (e.g., A, B), while `referred` enables the referred NFTs (A, B) to be aware that who has quoted it (e.g., A &#8592; D; C &#8592; E; B &#8592; E, and A &#8592; E). The `createdTimestamp` is an indicator used to show the creation time of NFTs (A, B, C, D, E).

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

`Relationship`: a structure that contains `referring`, `referred`, `createdTimestamp`, and other customized attributes such as `mapping (uint256 => address) privityOfAgreement` recording the ownerships of referred NFTs at the time the rNFTs were being created.
`referring`: an out-degree indicator, used to show the users this NFT refers to;
`referred`: an in-degree indicator, used to show the users who have refereed this NFT;
`createdTimestamp`: a time-based indicator, used to compare the timestamp of mint.

`safeMint`: mint a new rNFT;
`setNode`: set the referring list of an rNFT and update the referred list of each one in the referring list;
`setNodeReferring`: set the referring list of an rNFT;
`setNodeReferred`: set the referred list of the given rNFTs;
`referringOf`:  Get the referring list of an rNFT;
`referredOf`: Get the referred list of an rNFT.

## Rationale
This standard is intended to establish the referable DAG for queries on cross-relationship and accordingly provide the simplest functions. It provides advantages as follows.

*Clear ownership inheritance*: This standard extends the static NFT into a virtually extensible NFT network. Artists do not have to create work isolated from others. The ownership inheritance avoids reinventing the same wheel.

*Incentive Compatibility*: This standard clarifies the referable relationship across different NFTs, helping to integrate multiple up-layer incentive models for both original NFT owners and new creators.

*Easy Integration*: This standard makes it easier for the existing token standards or third-party protocols. For instance, the rNFT can be collaborating with the Top-down composible NFT (cf. [EIP-998](./eip-998.md) to build a finer-grained reference relationship, where the `Relationship` structure and the interface `IERC_rNFT` can be seamlessly stored and updated when invoking the `mint` function). Another example is that the rNFT can be applied to rentable scenarios (cf. [EIP-5006](./eip-5006.md) to build a hierarchical rental market, where multiple users can rent the same NFT during the same time or one user can rent multiple NFTs during the same duration). 

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard can be fully [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) compatible by adding an extension function set.

## Test Cases
Truffle and Openzeppelin are required to run the following in a test network.
```node
truffle develop
rNFT = await ERC_rNFT.new("ERC_rNFT","ERC_rNFT")
rNFT.safeMint(1,[])
rNFT.referredOf(1)
rNFT.referringOf(1)

rNFT.safeMint(2,[1])
rNFT.referredOf(2)
rNFT.referringOf(2)

rNFT.safeMint(3,[1,2])
rNFT.referredOf(2)
rNFT.referredOf(3)
rNFT.referringOf(3)

```

```

## Security Considerations
The `createdTimestamp` only covers the block-level timestamp (based on block headers), which does not support fine-grained comparisons such as transaction-level.

The change of ownership has nothing to do with the reference relationship. Normally, the distribution of profits complies to the aggreement when the NFT was being created regardless of the change of ownership unless specified in the agreement.

In the context of collaborating with [EIP-998](./eip-998.md), referring a token will not refer its descendants by default. In the case that only a specific child token gets referred, it means the privity of contract will involve nobody other than the owner of this specific child token. Alternatively, a chain-of-reference all the way from the root token to a specific very bottom child token (from root to leaf) can be constructured and recorded in the `referring` to explicitly define the distribution of profits.
